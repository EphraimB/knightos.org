For the most part, KnightOS devs prefer to collaborate over IRC (Internet Relay
Chat). To join with webchat in your browser, please [visit this
link](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=knightos&uio=d4). You can also
connect directly to `#knightos` on `irc.freenode.net` with your favorite IRC
client. While chatting with us, please observe these rules:

* Be nice.
* Stay mostly on topic. Off topic discussion is permitted in `#knightos-ot`.
* Don't ask for release dates. We don't do release dates here.
