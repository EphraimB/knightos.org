# Getting Started with KnightOS Assembly

This tutorial is a work in progress.

KnightOS is designed to be very hackable. As a programmer, you will especially
enjoy using it. You'll find it to be a very flexible enviornment that gives you
a lot of tools to work with. On top of that, everything is open source, meaning
that you can get the code for it and modify it to suit your needs, or help
improve it so that the rest of the world benefits, too. This is a general
purpose tutorial to introduce a number of important concepts and get your
enviornment up and running. You can help improve it by submitting pull requests
to [KnightOS/knightos.org](https://github.com/KnightOS/knightos.org) on GitHub.
