    Stub: <p>Cryptographic hashing functions</p>
    
    
    Summary: <p>KnightOS offers minimal cryptographic support, including SHA-1, MD5, and CRC. CRC and MD5 are suitable for data validation, and SHA-1 is suitable for cryptographic hashing. This statement is true in 2014, but may not hold up long after this document is written. Always research the latest news in cryptography before settling on an algorithm.</p>
    

    Color
    
    Stub: <p>Color graphics and display driver</p>
    
    
    Summary: <p>KnightOS supports the TI-84+ Color Silver Edition. This calculator uses a <a href="http://www.displayfuture.com/Display/datasheet/controller/ILI9335.pdf">ILI9335 display</a>, which has a resolution of 320x240. KnightOS uses 16-bit colors, in the format 0bRRRRRGGGGGGBBBBB.
Due to the size of the screen, and the speed requirements for driving it, KnightOS programs do not use an in-memory buffer. An uncompressed image the full size of the screen takes up more than all addressable memory on the device. Instead, we've provided functions for drawing directly to the LCD.
Generally speaking, the color you wish to draw with is provided in the IY register (which is used for the monochrome buffer in non-color applications).
The kernel supports both monochrome and color display modes on the same calculator, and even running at the same time. We refer to monochrome mode as "legacy mode", and color mode as "color mode". Your program should tell the kernel which mode you'd like to use, and the kernel will handle the switching semantics to help you coorperate with the rest of the enviornment.</p>

    Filesystem
    
    Stub: <p>Low-level filesystem driver</p>
    
    
    Summary: <p>These functions are part of the low-level filesystem driver, and interact directly with the filesystem tree. To read or write files, see the <a href="/documentation/reference/filestreams.html">filestream reference</a>.</p>
    

    Flash
    
    Stub: <p>Low-level Flash storage driver</p>
    
    
    Summary: <p>Manipulating Flash can be dangerous and lead to severe data loss. Please only use these functions if you feel qualified that you can safely work with them. Nearly all of them require Flash to be unlocked first, via <a href="#unlockFlash">unlockFlash</a>.</p>

    Threading
    
    Stub: <p>Thread creation and management</p>
    
    
    Summary: <p>The default kernel configuration allows for up to 32 threads to be running simultaneously. It is possible to change this number by reconfiguring your kernel, and userspace programs should not depend on this number to be accurate.</p>
    

    Time

    Summary: <p>The hardware clock is not present on all devices, but time/date mathematics is available on all platforms.</p>

    Display
    
    Stub: <p>Monochrome graphics and display driver</p>
    
    
    Summary: <p>The monochrome display is 96x64 pixels. KnightOS programs are expected to allocate a 768-byte buffer of memory, and place the address in IY <a href="display.html#allocScreenBuffer">allocScreenBuffer</a> does this for you). You may use <a href="#fastCopy">fastCopy</a> to copy this buffer to the display.
This page documents monochrome functions. For the color display, see <a href="/documentation/reference/color">color</a>.</p>
    

    Filestreams
    
    Stub: <p>File stream manipulation</p>
    
    
    Summary: <p>File streams allow you to read from or write to files on the filesystem. It operates at a higher level than the <a href="/documentation/reference/filesystem.html">filesystem driver</a> does.</p>
