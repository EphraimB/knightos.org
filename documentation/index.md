KnightOS is intended to be a great playground for TI programmers. if you're familiar with
Unix, you'll feel at home here.

## Getting Started

Programmers who do not know assembly should wait until kpy is implemented. Programmers
who *do* know assembly can get started right away. A good place to start learning is
[*Learning KnightOS Concepts*](/documentation/concepts.html), and then you should move on to
[*Writing Userland Programs*](/documentation/programs.html) to really get going. Programmers
are encouraged to join our IRC channel to ask questions and offer feedback. You can join by
pointing your IRC client to #knightos on irc.freenode.net, or by clicking the link on top
of this page.

## Reference Documentation

This website publishes [reference documentation](/documentation/reference/) for the kernel
API and important userspace libraries.

Please note that prior to version 1.0.0, API compatability is not guaranteed.
