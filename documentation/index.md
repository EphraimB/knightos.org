# Documentation

**Note: KnightOS is still in development and documentation efforts are ongoing.**

KnightOS is designed with programmers in mind. The system itself is written entirely in z80 assembly,
and the API is meant to be easy to use for those familiar with programming on the stock OS. There are
a number of additional considerations, however, that you should keep in mind when working with
KnightOS.

## Kernel Documentation

The following links document the kernel API, which is available for userspace programs and works
on any KnightOS-based operating system. It is generated from comments in the kernel source code.
You'll need to include kernel.inc to use these in your programs (this file is generated when compiling
the kernel).
