As of today, knightos.org doesn't look like Yet Another Bootstrap Site! This
isn't a particularly newsworthy event but I feel the need to populate the list
of blog posts since we haven't really been blogging about this project.

If you have any improvements you'd like to make, feel free to send us a pull
request. The site is hosted on GitHub pages, and you can check it out here:
[github.com/KnightOS/knightos.org](https://github.com/KnightOS/knightos.org). 
This design was largely inspired by [blender.org](http://blender.org/), if you
were wondering.
