    <h1>KnightOS <small>An open source OS for TI calculators</small></h1>
</div>
<p>KnightOS is an open-source operating system for TI calculators. It completely replaces
the stock TI-OS, and offers loads of great features for programmers and users alike:</p>

<p>KnightOS supports the TI-73, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, TI-84+, TI-84+ Silver Edition, 
TI-84+ Color Silver Edition, and the French variations on these devices.</p>
<h2>KnightOS for Users</h2>
<p>Sorry! KnightOS isn't quite ready for everyone. Currently, only technically proficient users
will realistically be able to use the system. You can still
<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=knightos&uio=d4">join us on IRC</a> to keep an eye
on our progress and share your ideas.</p>
<h2>KnightOS for Programmers</h2>
<p>KnightOS will feel like a welcome change for programmers used to TI-OS. Coding for KnightOS
feels like coding for Unix. You've got full blown memory management, a tree-based filesytem (one
that follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard), and more "Safe RAM" than you can shake a stick at.
KnightOS is also completely open source, which means that you can get involved in the development.
The source code is availble <a href="https://github.com/KnightOS">online</a> and you're encouraged
to play around with it. If you see something you'd rather be different, or features you want, you
can join us <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=knightos&uio=d4">on IRC</a> and help
build it yourself!</p>
<p>KnightOS is also <a href="/documentation">painstakingly documented</a>, so you'll
always know how it works. To get started writing programs for KnightOS,
