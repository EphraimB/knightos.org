<h2>How can I help?</h2>
<p>KnightOS could always use some help from programmers and non-programmers alike. If you're
a coder, you'll love working with the codebase and building neat things. If
you aren't, you can still help out by helping us write documentation, spreading the word, or
by simply hanging out with us to offer your thoughts on what you want KnightOS to be. Come
<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=knightos&uio=d4">join us on IRC</a> to get to
know us and share your thoughts. We do have to sleep sometimes, so be patient. We may not
be around when you arrive, so say "hello" and sit tight for a while.</p>
<p>We're also interested in calculator donations. If you can spare one, please get in touch
on IRC and we'll work it out.</p>
<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
<p>If you're a user, you may want to sit tight. KnightOS is not done yet, and isn't ready for
general use. However, if you're a programmer, you can dive in and start hacking on it right
now. The same does apply to you, though: it's not done, so expect a little difficulty. To get
started writing code for KnightOS, head over to the <a href="/documentation">documentation</a>.
You are strongly encouraged to hang out in the IRC channel, where your questions can be
answered and you can learn more about the project.</p>
