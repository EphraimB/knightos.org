                <h2>KnightOS</h2>
                <h3>An open source operating system for TI calculators</h3>
                <p>KnightOS is a replacement for the stock OS on several TI calculators. It offers many things the stock OS does not, and delivers it
                in a fully open source enviornment. KnightOS draws its inspiration from Unix, with preemptive multitasking, dynamic memory allocation,
                a tree-based filesystem, and more. You'll feel right at home with this powerful OS, especially if you're a programmer.</p>
                <p>With KnightOS, z80 programmers get the benefit of write once, run anywhere. KnightOS has a long list of supported calculator models,
                and the code you write for one is likely to run on all of them. You can also use the kernel independently of the rest, creating
                different, unique distributions of KnightOS. Even better, most KnightOS programs will run on any KnightOS-based distribution.</p>
                <p>Although you're welcome to try it out, please note that KnightOS is still in development. Bugs are to be expected, and many things
                will change in the meantime. Please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/KnightSoft/KnightOS/issues/new">create issues</a> when you
                find bugs, or when you want to request new features. Sounds good? Great, then head over to the <a href="/downloads.html">download page</a>
                to grab a copy!</p>
