    <h1>KnightOS <small>An open source OS for TI calculators</small></h1>
</div>
<p>KnightOS is a replacement for the stock OS on several Texas Instruments calculators. It
provides a Unix-like enviornment that makes it great for students and programmers alike. With advanced
features like a tree-based filesystem, multitasking, and more, KnightOS is the perfect operating system
for your calculator's needs. <span class="text-error">Note: KnightOS is not yet complete, and it is not
ready for general use</span>. The kernel is nearing completion, though.</p>

            <h3>Multitasking</h3>
            <p>Run up to 32 concurrent programs, and switch between them with ease.</p>

            <h3>Terminal</h3>
            <p>A built-in bash-like terminal gives more flexibility to power users and programmers.</p>

            <h3>Crash Recovery</h3>
            <p>Forget the days of clearing your RAM and losing data. KnightOS crashes are non-destructive.</p>

            <img src="/img/gui.gif" alt="KnightOS GUI" />
            <h3>GUI</h3>
            <p>Integrated GUI libraries allow programs to easily design complex interfaces.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the KnightOS userspace, the project includes a seperate kernel that powers all the impressive
bits of technology in play here - the filesystem, multitasking, etc, all handled by this kernel. It's not tied to
KnightOS at all, and you're free to build your own OSes with this powerful base.</p>
